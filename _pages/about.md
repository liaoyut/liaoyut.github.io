<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Masterâ€™s student at the School of Software, Northeastern University, supervised by Associate Professor Jun Na and Professor Bin Zhang. My research focuses on large language model (LLM)-based intelligent investment advisory systems, exploring interdisciplinary innovations in natural language processing and fintech. Currently, I also serve as an â€‹Algorithm Internâ€‹ at the Shenyang Financial Information Industry Technology Research Institute, where I contribute to core algorithm development and project implementation in financial technology.
